# A Voyage into LLMs: From Inception to Mastery

Welcome to the SoC project 'A Voyage into LLMs: From Inception to Mastery'. Here we're going to delve deep into NLP and LLMs and cover all the aspects, starting from the basics, with no prerequisites involved. 

## About the project

The project will aim to cover LLMs and NLP from the basics while going into depth on each topic for better understanding. Throughout this project, mentees will dive into Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and PyTorch, while exploring deep learning concepts.
